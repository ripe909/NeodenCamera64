# NeodenCamera64
Initial work on a Visual Studio 2019 solution for NeodenCamera DLL for x64.  I have zero experience writing a DLL, so I am just trying to follow the work started by charlie-x.

It is currently configured to build as an DLL for debugging.  

It is nominally functional!

You will need to download and install the Cypress SDK and fix the includes to point to your SDK install location
